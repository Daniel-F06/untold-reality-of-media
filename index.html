    <h2>Essay Excerpt</h2>
    <p>
      Media is a single-faced communication venue. It tells you what is there and it puts you into
      its grip, but it does not suggest you or tell you what problems you may face later with it. For
      instance, you may want to become super-anorexic now, and you may succeed too, but later
      the eating disorders might ruin your life. You might purchase a beauty product which is
      exactly the same to what your favorite celebrity uses. With so much engrossment into
      advertisements, you later start facing skin problems or rashes that you realize are going to
      exist forever. Watching violence on television may be entertaining at first, but what if the
      next day you see your kid carrying a gun at school which according to him is "just for fun!!"
      Media succeeds in creating a current successful impact on its viewers, but it does not
      provide sufficient information about the after-effects of such a success.

    <h2>To whom is the author writing?</h2>
    <p>Suman Shafi's point of view is in second-person, therefore the author is pertaining to the readers, particularly the young people — whom are exposed to media. The numerous instances of the author stating "you" supports this, so that it further encapsulates and immerses the readers' thoughts.</p>

    <h2>Explain the last sentence according to what you have learned from the lesson</h2>
    <p>The concluding sentence is anchored around the negative effects of media. Specifically, the lasting impact it has on viewers. It seeks to shed light on the after-effects that media provides. This is supported by the stated examples on negative effects of media—influence, risks to well-being, and violence.</p>
